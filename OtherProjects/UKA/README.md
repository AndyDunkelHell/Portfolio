# Uni Clinic Aachen
In this section I wish to shortly introduce some of my other projects I developed during my work at the University Clinic of Aachen. 

Firstly, I developed a blender project in order to Parametrically generate an Ovaloid object that will be used in the development of a Wrist endoprosthesis. I did this using a plugin called svershock and my Unity knowledge.

Secondly I would like to introduce to you a 3D-printed Vice I designed in order to properly hold a Tibia Phantom. This vice was used in a Test rig created to test the aforementioned Wrist endoprosthesis.
