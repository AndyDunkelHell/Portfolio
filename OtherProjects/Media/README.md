# Media Projects

In this section you will find some of the media content I have participated in creating. I was usually involved in both the production and editing of compelling media content to promote the different products and activities to raise awareness and encourage participation from the public.  I have always tried to cultivate my creative side, because I think a good engineer must not only have a developed logical side, but also a great creative side.  

Below you will be a small teaser of two videos I participated in and one poster I created. These are my favorite projects among many I helped create.

Furthermore, in the YouTube channel of the ![AWO Kreisverband Aachen-Stadt e.V. I](https://www.youtube.com/@awokreisverbandaachen-stad3461) I participated in videos of their channel up to 2022, including a 360 degree video tour of the city of Aachen and a live stream for Karneval 2021. 

Finally you can find some videos in my personal ![youtube channel] (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdisWnISnJLQ6v6fTtsIdaw) I did during my exchange year in Germany!
