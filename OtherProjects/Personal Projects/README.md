# Portfolio
 In this section I would like to refer you to some of my other repositories I created in order to implement specific projects that improve my day-to-day life. I usually use these projects to learn a specific skill set I still do not have but that I think can be relevant in my Field.  My bachelor thesis on the [`3D-printed Bionic hand`](https://github.com/AndyDunkelHell/ProjectBBH) started as one such project and I have started other projects like [`tektonHome`](https://github.com/AndyDunkelHell/tektonHome) and [`piCamTVLED`](https://github.com/AndyDunkelHell/piCamTVLED). All this is in order to learn programming skills such as Next.js, React, Java, Kotlin and programming for C embedded Software.

Finally, here you can find my [`profile`](https://www.printables.com/@DunkelHell_1938986) on Printables where you can see some of my 3D-Printed designs for personal use.
